## Introduction

This repository contains the under-development integration work between Solana and Axelar, enabling seamless cross-chain communication through smart contracts and off-chain microservices. The project includes the development of General Message Passing (GMP) contracts, additional service contracts, and microservices for event monitoring and transaction broadcasting.
